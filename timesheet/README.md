## Overview

This is a script that will assist you with entering your Hive timesheet.

## Preparing the script for entering time for the week

Review the data in fill-timesheet.js within the function getData(). This is how your timesheet
will be filled out.

If you are missing clients or projects, you will have to view the source of the timesheet page
to determine the appropriate code for the client or project in question. Please note that the project
codes are unique for each client.


## Filling your timesheet

**NOTE: When you run this script, your existing timesheet will be cleared and REPLACED with the data
from this script.**

1. Navigate Chrome so you can see your current timesheet, such as

    https://hive.ltgplc.com/TimesheetEntry/Timesheet.aspx

2. Copy the contents of the script to your clipboard.

3. Open **Developer Tools** (**Control-Shift-I**) and select the **Console** tab.

4. Paste the contents of the script from your clipboard.
